# Optional Enhancements

## Goal

Optional enhancements are meant to spark our imagination! They can give us extra ideas for how to extend this project. Optional enhancements should never compromise the project requirements, unless there are special circumstances.

## Optional Means Optional

It is more important and more valuable to do good work with the requirements, and to solidify your learning. Please do not work on optional enhancements before feeling confident in the project requirements.

## Prompts

### Reset Button

Create a button in the `App` component. When this button is clicked, it will reset the game's state and clear all the game squares.  

### Tests

There are tests provided for this optional enhancement!

Unskip these tests to verify if the reset button resets the grid. The provided tests check for:

- When the reset button (with the text "Reset Game") is clicked, the grid should go back to blank squares. It selects all the `<button class="square"></button>` elements and verifies that they have no text.
- Immediately after the reset button is clicked, the text "Winner is o" or "Winner is x" should not appear.
